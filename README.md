# Project_Manager
It is one of my favourite repos i ever published on github
the script main.py is the main script, for it to use, you should enter your details in the configuration.txt

dont worry with your privacy to write your username and password in the text file, run encryption.py script and it will give 
you an encrypted text for your username and password,

you just have to write that encrypted text the configuration.txt, set the project_path and you are good to go,
run the main.py script and you have to just enter your project name in as the input and else all will be done by the script,
from making a github repo to adding VCS (git) to it, now you can just focus on writing code for your project straight away !

Just run it by using python3 main.py
